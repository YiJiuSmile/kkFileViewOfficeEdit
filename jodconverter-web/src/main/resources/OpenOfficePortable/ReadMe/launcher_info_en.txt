1. X-Software_launcher informations and usage
---------------------------------------------
This package includes a X-Software_launcher that allows to freely change 
all the starting options of programs, in order to make them portable, i.e. 
runnable by removable storage devices, like USB keys or external hard disks. 
Download the software from the author's website or from winpenpack.com 
download section and execute one of the following operations:

a) if a .zip version is available from author's website, 
   decompress it to a folder of your choice;

b) if the setup version is supported by Universal Extractor
   (http://legroom.net/software/uniextract), extract it to a 
   folder of your choice;

c) if the setup version is not supported by 
   Universal Extractor extract it using Innounp
   (http://innounp.sourceforge.net/);

d) install the setup normally to your hard disk, copy the 
   installation folder from C:\Program Files and than uninstall 
   the program.

Copy all executable files to the \Bin\Software\ folder.
Launch the program by double-clicking on X-Software.exe 
For more informations, please follow the guidelines to

2. Launcher usage with Java programs
------------------------------------
If the program associated to the launcher requires Java Runtime Environment, 
download it from http://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp choosing 
"Windows XP/Vista/2000/2003 Offline", install it on hard disk and 
copy "bin" and "lib" java  folders (from C:\Program Files\Java\jre1.XXX) 
into X-Software_name\Lib\Java folder (this will "delete" the intermediate 
folder "jre1.XXX"). Then uninstall Java from your hard disk.



3. How to update the launcher to the new version
------------------------------------------------
The update can be done manually, overwriting the files Software.exe 
and X-Software.ini inside the X-Software folder, or in \winPenPack\XDrive, 
if the program is included in winPenPack. In this case it is also possible 
to update automatically the launcher importing it in the menu through the 
"Install X-Software.." option of winPenPack Menu.
