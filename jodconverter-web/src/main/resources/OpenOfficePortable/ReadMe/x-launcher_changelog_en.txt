In this new version, the winPenPack Team has greatly improved the code of previous
1.1 version, developed by original author, Gabriele Tittonel.

4. Change Log
-------------

Pending Modifications :

- (Bug fixed) Bug StringReplace: the launcher stops with error if start and stop
  directives contain uppercase characters other than the ones contained into the
  file to modify.



Modifications between 1.5.0 and 1.5.1 releases:

- (Improvement) JavaGet: installation of Java update in \Lib folder even if Java is found
  both in the guest PC.



Modifications between 1.4.3 and 1.5.0 releases:

- (Bug fixed) IsClosing bug: in case of previous system crash, the "X-Software is closing"
  message was shown, preventing to run the Software until manual deletion of temporary files.

- (Bug Fixed) Bug SystemLanguage: recognized system language when LANG environment
   variable is not found.

- (Improvement) HideShellWindow: new option that allow to hide the command shell window
  for the programs that shows it.

- (Improvement) _PathEncode: new function that allow to centralize the decoding of
  particular characters in the paths, still using, for backward compatibility, the "%20"
  string that triggers the function.

- (Improvement) JavaGet: integration of JavaGet functionalities into the launcher.
  New functionality: if Java is not installed into \Lib folder, but is installed into
  the guest PC, the latter is used, without downloading and installing Java into \Lib
  folder. Added management of particular cases of installed Java corrupted configurations.
  If Java is found both in the guest PC and in the Pack, is used the latest version.

- (Improvement) FirstRunOperations: new .ini file section "FirstRunOperations" and new
  "FirstRun" option for execute (only when "FirstRun=true") following commands: _DirCopy,
  _DirCreate, _DirMove, _DirRemove, _FileCopy, _FileCreatePlus, _FileDelete, _FileMove,
  _RunWait. This function, after the execution of the commands into the "FirstRunOperations"
  section, sets FirstRun=false.

- (Improvement) TrayTip: new function, absolutely equivalent to ShowSplash, that shows a
  traybar alert at each launcher execution.



Modifications between 1.4.2 and 1.4.3 releases:

- (Bug fixed) Startup parameters: fixed bug in the handling of multiple
  startup parameters when running programs.

- (Improvement) DirRemove: new option for DirRemove function; allows to
  recursively delete only empty folders.



Modifications between 1.3.1 and 1.4 releases:

- (Bug fixed) Splash Screen: code rewritten for increase programs startup

  CPU consumption (fixed using the RunWait() instruction and other tricks).

- (BugFix) IsRunning bug: starting multiple istances of an application,
  at the second run IsRunning is set to False, so, on the third (fith,
  seventh, etc.) run, the Launcher is executed as was the first one.

- (BugFix) Single Launcher bug: if the X-Launcher.cfg file is not
  properly set, the temporary folders are overwritten.

- (BugFix) Java applications bug: with Java applications, the RunAfter
  section was not correctly processed if multiple Java (istances or
  applications) was executed.
