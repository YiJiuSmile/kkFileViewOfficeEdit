1. Introduction
---------------
Please read the wpp_info_en.txt file



2. Description of produced material
-----------------------------------

a) winPenPack

   winPenPack is an applications environment of Free Software, modified for being 
   run and used from an USB pendrive, without need of installation. It is a really 
   self-contained environment, within programs, .xml and config files, documents 
   are homogeneously integrated. Portable software included into winPenPack does 
   not need to be installed, does not write their settings into host PC, and can 
   be easily carried between multiple computers through any external device, as 
   removable hard disks or USB pendrives. Programs are subdivided in categories 
   and executable through a practical menu, analogue to Windows menu Start, the 
   winPenPack Launcher. winPenPack suites are available in the following editions: 
   Flash Essential, Flash 2Gb, Flash School, Flash Web and Flash Game.


b) X-Software

   X-Software, distributed in .zip or .exe format or hosted by our or other 
   authorized mirrors, are created and developed by winPenPack Team. Each 
   X-Software is composed by a launcher, X-Launcher, that allow to modify, 
   as one likes, program startup options for let it portable, that runs an 
   existing not natively portable program, through an .ini configuration file. 
   X-Software, X-Launchers and .ini files created for portabilize programs 
   are exclusive work of winPenPack development Team, and constitute integrant 
   part of winPenPack.


c) winPenPack Menu

   winPenPack Menu (or winPenPack Launcher) is the menu for launching applications 
   collected in winPenPacks, created by winPenPack Team for the project.


d) Portable Software

   Portable Software are programs that are executed on host PC without 
   leaving tracks of their execution. Generally, they don't reside in our 
   site, but they are present as direct links to files hosted on the 
   developer/distributor site. These software are just identified and 
   indicated in related pages for a possible download.


e) Website and documentation

   The winPenPack official domain is winpenpack.com with mirror on winpenpack.it, 
   winpenpack.org, winpenpack.info, winpenpack.eu and winpenpack.net. The project 
   is hosted also on SourceForge (http://sourceforge.net/projects/winpenpack). The 
   site hosts all winPenPacks, programs, source code, configuration files and all 
   documentation created by winPenPack development Team, collaborators, community 
   members.
   

f) Source code and development

   You can contribute to the growth of the project by further developing winPenPack 
   components. The complete source code is available in the respective download pages.

5. Redistribution under unmodified form
---------------------------------------

Redistribution and spreading of winPenPack materials under unmodified form (official 
setups and .zip archives of X-Software released under Open Source licenses, 
unmodified setups and .zip archives of winPenPacks downloadable by winpenpack.com, 
X-Launcher, winPenPack menu Launcher, all documentation) on mirrors different from 
official ones, on DVD provided with magazines, websites and through other forms of 
redistribution, is authorized, provided that is acknowledged and clearly specified 
original work paternity, explicitly referring to winPenPack as inspirer source, adding 
always a link to winpenpack.com in publications, newspapers, magazines, web sites and 
every other information channel. Sale for profit of materials (under modified or 
unmodified form) containing winPenPack trademarks is NOT allowed.
X-Software containing Freeware programs are software for which it has been obtained 
explicit written authorization by their respective owners to their redistribution in 
portable form, granted only to winPenPack Team, not to the users. For this reason, any 
other redistribution form, other than winPenPack one and without respective authors 
authorization, could be considered illegal. Portable Software, property of each 
author/programmer, can be redistributed referring to their original licenses agreement. 
We acknowledge registered marks and commercial names to legal owners. All documents 
present in winpenpack.com web site (texts, .pdf, tutorials, etc..), also if freely 
downloadable, can be redistributed in unmodified form only, and must necessarily show 
the titular source of the rights and attribute the paternity of the work originates 
them, if published by newspapers, magazines, publications, other web sites and any 
other information channel.

General Public License, or equivalent licenses, then creating derivative works, 
and also copying and distributing this modified materials, stating explicitly 
that is a modified copy and also each modification date.


winPenPack development Team resolve to be derivative works:

   to winPenPack, and/or "false" reference, leading to 
   winPenPack, that could confuse the user; must not contain 
   the name winPenPack (for example, X-winPenPack, winPenPack 
   Plus, winPenPack Mod, etc..) nor any other names confusingly 
   similar to the name winPenPack (for example, win-PenPack, 
   winPenPak, winPenPach, etc..);

End users can:

a) use for free and legally official winPenPacks, 
   software and materials ruled from Open Source 
   licenses, in any place (home, school, office, 
   etc.);
   
b) do legal copies of winPenPacks for friends, 
   kins or anyone else;

c) use modified copies of winPenPack for personal 
   projects and initiatives, or create and distribute 
   derivative works from official winPenPacks, from 
   X-Software and from materials produced by winPenPack 
   Team, stating crearly, in accord with above terms, 
   that they are modified copies based on winPenPack

The Development Team is open to feasible collaborations, finalized to create 
personalized software and collections. Regarding modifications of X-Software 
containing Freeware programs, above indications are still valid (point 5). 
Portable Software, released under "Freeware", "Freeware for personal use" and 
open source licenses (GPL, LGPL, MPL, etc.), can be modified in the terms of 
their original licenses agreement.




7. Paternity attribution
------------------------

We believe that, for our work, performed day by day absolutely for free, 
acknowledgement of work paternity is the necessary fulfillment for assure 
its prosecution. For this reason we ask to anyone distributes winPenPack 
or its components in unmodified form, and to the authors of derivative 
works based on winPenPack, on winPenPack menu Launcher, on X-Software 
or X-Launcher, to clearly referring to winPenPack project and to his 
authors, adding always a link to winpenpack.com into source files and 
documents included into software packs, and into web pages of site hosting 
and distributing derivative works.
With these indications we don't intend to limit freedom and right to use 
and modify our materials (we make source code available, with the purpose 
of stimulate the development), but we wish that everyone collaborate for 
respecting licenses and authors rights. For more details please read also 
the additional notes about trademarks and copyright to point 8.




8. Copyright and trademarks infringement notice
-----------------------------------------------

Programs used to create related portable versions are programs released 
only under open source licenses and are associated with X-Software generally 
in decompressed mode (extracted zip archive or extracted setup) and not 
modified form, hardly ever in a modified form.

Some images used in web site, in download section and in splash screens of 
our portable software are original work of winPenPack Team, other images 
are created by modifying pre-existing open source images, and others, always 
released under open source licenses (GPL/LGPL, etc.. .) are downloaded from 
websites of original programs or from sites awarding free licensed images 
(such as http://iconlet.com) and they are used in unmodified form.

It is our purpose to do every effort in order to respect programs and images 
licenses and trademarks rights. But, although our efforts, and because of 
some factors beyond our control, could however be found some violation. 
Regarding this point, if the author of an image, a software or any other 
material used by winPenPack, detects a not allowed usage, or if considers 
that its author rights, trademark or copyright have been violated, please 
report it to the Development Team. We will make immediately the appropriate 
adjustments.
